# Blockchain---PyChain-Ledger

In this challenge I am a fintech engineer whoâ€™s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. I was recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. My task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

I have made the following updates to the provided Python file for this assignment, which already contains the basic PyChain ledger structure that you created throughout the module:

1. Create a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.

2. Modify the existing Block data class to store Record data.

3. Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit interface.

4. Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records.

### datetime - Datetime in Python is the combination between dates and times. The attributes of this class are similar to both date and separate classes. These attributes include day, month, year, minute, second, microsecond, hour, and tzinfo.
### streamlit - Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
### pandas - Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
### hashlib - Hashlib is a Python module that implements an interface to different secure hash algorithms and digest algorithms. Hashlib is a secure hash and message digest algorithm library.
